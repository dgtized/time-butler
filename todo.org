** TODO Consider ordering graphs series in descending order

   A little tricky as I think needs to calculate either average or median value of each line over the time period in order to rank in the series, but worth trying at some point.

** TODO Specify series color more carefully to ignore the invisible yellow

   I think could just have a color array and call set line color after each series definition?

** TODO Add median, and 90th percentile to raw json output in addition to mean? 
** TODO Normalize flake/failure percentage graphs and report count separately
** TODO Namespace Rollbar UUID by project somehow to avoid project collisions

If TimeButler is used on multiple projects the project name should probably be
included in the uuid generation so uuid's for items are namespaced to a
particular project. Only problem is that doing this will generate new uuid's for
existing installs, breaking the existing histories.
